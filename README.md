## 🎯 System Description

BinBuddy is a **Smart Waste Tracking & Rewards Platform** that:

- Allows households to **log waste disposal** (biodegradable, recyclable, residual, special) via QR scan or manual entry
- Awards **EcoPoints** for proper segregation, verified by waste collectors
- Enables users to **redeem EcoPoints** for mobile load, vouchers, and discounts
- Provides **waste collectors** with digital pickup lists and verification tools
- Gives **barangay administrators** real-time dashboards with compliance metrics
- Includes a **Smart Segregation Guide** with a "Is this recyclable?" checker
- Features **gamification**: streaks, badges, challenges, and a community leaderboard

### Why BinBuddy?

- Metro Manila generates **9,500 tons of waste per day**
- Only **30% is properly recycled**
- **12 million households** in Metro Manila, concentrated in Quezon City
- RA 9003 mandates waste segregation at source — BinBuddy makes this rewarding and trackable
